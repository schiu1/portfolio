<h1>My Projects</h1>

<p>This project is my first game I have ever made in my free time. It started in the Summer of 2016. Its gameplay is similar to a turn-based Role-Playing-Game but entirely through text. It has different weapons with attacks that are tied to each. Each enemy you defeat will increase your stats based on their strength.<img src="btlGame.png" style="float:right" width="500" height="500">
